# Where possible the project tries to apply POI categories and attributes according
# to OSM specifications which is in itself something of an art form. Where the attribution
# cannot be done through NSI related pipeline magic then a spider is free to apply any
# categories and attributes itself. This file provides some help in that area. It certainly
# reduces the number of finger fumble mistypes which are the inevitable by-product
# of lots of string bashing. If ever NSI / ATP where to change / augment the category scheme
# then the level of indirection provided here may also be of help!
