"""
Hy-Vee has 155 locations we need to scrape, they implemented a server-side javascript detector logic
that returns just the HTML head with an empty body asking that we enable javascript to browse the site.
Unfortunately, The server returns no content for us to process except we use the PUT method.

This is the reason for reimplementing the start_requests so we can pass the PUT method to our request object.
We loop through the cities on https://www.hy-vee.com/stores/store-finder-results.aspx
to build the a url that looks like this
https://www.hy-vee.com/stores/store-finder-results.aspx?zip=&state=&city=CITY,STATECODE&olfloral=...

This usually return 1 result and in some cases 0.
and provides us with a link to a details page where we get more detailed store info.
The detailed store info page has no map so we just get the latlon from the store-finder-results page
and pass it over via the request object's meta.

The opening hours are very inconsistent and contains lots of words.
I tried to solve this by creating a dict of possible words, and mapping them appropriately.

Update Nov-2019: PUT requests stopped working, GET requests now work
