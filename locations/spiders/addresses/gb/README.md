# United Kingdom

Currently, there are no authoritative Open Data Address sources in GB.

Official house numbers, names, streets are generated by Local Authorities, they are passed to Royal Mail who add
postcodes, they sell [Postcode Address File](https://www.poweredbypaf.com/postcode-address-file/) (PAF).
Ordnance Survey uses PAF + their own coords to
build [AddressBase](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/search-for-os-products?access=8cbf4982-4d6d-4d11-80eb-501a53fefc43&category=235715e6-641c-4927-8e47-cfd5d429699b&collection=afbdec93-e981-4705-86fc-b597d93355b4).
GeoPlace is also somehow involved.

The Royal Mail is rather protective of its copyright data. A late
[2025 court ruling](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/pdf/GetAddress%20Ideal%20Postcodes%20Judgement.pdf)
not only illustrates this but provides some useful background data in to
the history of address data in the UK and the issues involved.

Some further useful external GB sources around addressing include:

## Ordnance Survey Open Data

Under duress in 2020 Ordnance Survey released [OS Open UPRN](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/os-open-uprn)
and [OS Open USRN](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/os-open-usrn).
These datasets are nerfed to ensure the paid products maintain a captive audience.

OS Open UPRN includes coords and an id (Unique Property Reference Number), nothing more, no address, no status flag.
The dataset includes under construction and demolished entries to make it hard to use it.
UPRNs are mainly addresses, but are also assigned to streets, phone boxes, post boxes, electrical substations among
other things.
This dataset includes approximately 41M entries, [AddressBase](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/addressbase)
has 29M, [AddressBase Core](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/addressbase-core) has
33M, [AddressBase Plus](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/addressbase-plus) has 35M
and [AddressBase Premium](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/addressbase-premium) has 40M.

OS Open USRN includes simplified geom, street type and an id (Unique Street Reference Number).
There are about 1.7M entries.

| street_type                 | count   |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| Designated Street Name      | 973,114 |
| Officially Described Street | 483,364 |
| Numbered Street             | 279,643 |
| Unofficial Street Name      | 18,007  |

Ordnance Survey also release [OS Open Roads](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/os-open-roads) which includes
road names.
We can use [OS Open Linked Identifiers](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/os-open-linked-identifiers) to link
these datasets.

All these are Ordnance Survey datasets released as Open Data under the Open Government Licence v3.0 licence with the
following licence.txt:

```
ORDNANCE SURVEY DATA LICENCE

Your use of OS OpenData is subject to the terms at http://os.uk/opendata/licence.

The copyright acknowledgements to use for the attribution statement are:

`http://os.uk/opendata/licence` is currently a redirect

These datasets to NOT include house number/name/unit/flat or postcodes.
Ordnance Survey release a number of postcode datasets:

- [Code-Point with Polygons](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/code-point-polygons) includes Northern Ireland,
  this is NOT Open Data.
- [Code-Point](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/code-point) includes Northern Ireland, this is NOT Open Data.
- [Code-Point Open](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/code-point-open) just Great Britain (not Northern
  Ireland), just postcode centroids, this IS Open Data.

### Postcodes

All is not lost, Office for National Statistics (ONS not Ordnance Survey)
release [National Statistics UPRN Lookup](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/geographicalproducts/nationalstatisticsaddressproducts) (
NSUL).
This IS Open Data, released under the [Open Government Licence](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/licences).
This includes UPRNs and Postcodes (only postcodes available in Code-Point Open so no Northern Ireland).
For these UPRNs we can assign postcodes or build polygons.

### Postal Towns

`addr:city` is not actually linked to a literal city, but
a [postal town](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:addr:city).
These can generally be computed from the postcode.

[postal_towns.csv](postal_towns.csv) is generated from OSM, most common `addr:city` for the outward code.

## OpenStreetMap

OSM has some data available, it is great in some areas and missing in most.
Postcodes can be extended with the NSUL data.

## Local Authorities

Because Local Authorities are the ones creating house numbers/street names they have their own datasets.
These aren't often released, but when they are, they can be under any licence the authority chooses.

Owen Boswarva has collected UK council tax data with addresses and UPRNs via a number of Freedom of Information
requests.
The resulting data set(s) are then assigned postcodes and co-ordinates from public OS and ONS data by
Owen and published. Others are helping.
