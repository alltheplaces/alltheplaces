            # postcodes to those which are useful, but this is not
            # yet implemented in ATP and is a complex problem

            # One year later, the following search results were
            # observed for different population filter values:
            # 1. Population > 30000: 2843 locations returned
            #    from 2013 requests to the API.
            # 2. Population > 50000: 2824 locations returned
            #    from 629 requests to the API.

            # minimising API requests and obtaining as many
            # locations as possible.
            #
            # A website tracking Gamestop store closures indicates
            # that 55 stores were known to have closed in 2023 and
            # to the end of January 2024. Reference:
            # https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/
            #
            # The error margin therefore appears to be ~70 stores
            # (<2.5%) which this spider may miss due to reduction
            # in postcodes which are searched for stores.
            #
            # Note the search radius can be increased above 200
            # however this will result in API failures because
            # there is a limit of a 3MB response and 1 million
            # characters returned.
