    The source feature layer contains an enormous amount of duplicate features
    for which the ArcGIS Feature Server query API doesn't allow deduplication
    of. There are over 4 million features returned for this feature layer but
    only approximately 8000 non-duplicated features. The API has a "Return
    Distinct Values" feature but this only works for a single property field
    and including geometry or other fields in the expected output will result
    in this distinct values feature not working and 4 million plus features
    being returned. At 2000 features per request, this spider therefore has to
    make over 2000 requests for just 8000 non-duplicated features to be
    returned.
