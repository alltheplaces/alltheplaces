# To use this storefinder, supply an api_brand_name value as would
# be found in the following URL template:
# https://hosted.where2getit.com/{api_brand_name}/rest/...
# The api_key value needs to be supplied too and is found in the
# request parameters for a POST to this URL. It is formatted as a
# UUID (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).

# The api_filter value is optional and allows server-side
# filtering of store locations which will be returned. This is useful
# for spiders where you may want to only return official stores and
# not resellers of a brand's products. It is also useful for
# filtering out new stores not yet open, or stores which are closed
# but which haven't been removed from the database.

# Filters are a dictionary of nested rules that can include the
# following types of rules:
# * and     - all nested rules must return true
# * or      - at least one nested rule must return true
# * like    - a string must contain the specified string
#             (case sensitive)
# * ilike   - a string must contain the specified string
#           (case insensitive)
# * notlike - a string must not contain the specified string
# * in      - a string must match one of the strings specified in a
#             comma-separated list
# * notin   - a string must not match any of the strings specified
#             in a comma-separated list
# * eq      - a string must equal the specified string
# * ne      - a string must not equal the specified string
# * gt      - a number must be greater than the specified number
# * lt      - a number must be less than the specified number
# * ge      - a number must be greater than or equal to the specified
#             number
# * le      - a number must be less than or equal to the specified
#             number
# * between - a number must be between (including lower and upper
#             bounds) the number range specified as a
#             comma-separated list
#
# As an example:
# {"or": {"field1": {"in", "value1,value2,value3"},
#         "field2": {"eq", "value4"}
#        }
# }
#
# As filters are complex to understand, it is best to search spiders
# using "api_query" to see other examples of filters being used.

# Instead of Where2GetIt being provided as a service, it is also
# possible for brands to self-host the software at a custom domain
# name. If this is the case, change the api_endpoint value to be
# the custom API url ending in "/rest/getlist".

# If there are many store locations to return, it is possible the
# response will time out. If this is the case, try setting the
# value of the api_filter_admin_level to 1 for querying results
# country-by-country. If timeouts still occur, set
# api_filter_admin_level to 2 for querying results not just by
# country, but also state-by-state or province-by-province. If you
# still experience timeouts, you will need to overwrite the
# make_request function to use a more granular form of querying, for
# example, by city of each location.
