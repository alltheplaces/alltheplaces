class AmastyStoreLocatorSpider(Spider):
    """
    This store finder is provided as an extension either for Magento v1 or
    Magento v2. Some limited documentation on the store finder is provided as:
      v1: https://amasty.com/docs/doku.php?id=magento_1:store_locator
      v2: https://amasty.com/docs/doku.php?id=magento_2:store_locator

    To use this spider, specify one or more `allowed_domain`, and the default
    path `/amlocator/index/ajax/` will be requested. If for some reason the
    path is not default, it can be overridden by supplying the full path in
    `start_urls`. Some implementations of Amasty Store Finder limit the number
    of features returned per request and then expect the client to browse
    through multiple pages of results. If this is the case for spider,
    additionally toggle `pagination_mode` to `True`.

    JSON dictionaries are returned but are highly variable in the quantity and
    type of fields within. Ther is often a `popup_html` field in the JSON
    dictionaries which contains HTML data relating to the feature and whilst
    some of this `popup_html` is parsed by default, often there are fields
    such as addresses and phone numbers that need to be manually extracted by
    overriding the `pre_process_data` and/or `post_process_item` functions of
    this spider.
