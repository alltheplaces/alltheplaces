# This store finder is provided as an extension either for Magento
# v1 or Magento v2. Some limited documentation on the store finder
# is provided as:
# v1: https://amasty.com/docs/doku.php?id=magento_1:store_locator
# v2: https://amasty.com/docs/doku.php?id=magento_2:store_locator
#
# To use this spider, specify one or more allowed_domain, and the
# default path /amlocator/index/ajax/ will be requested. If for
# some reason the path is not default, it can be overridden by
# supplying full paths in start_urls.
#
# JSON blobs of location are returned but are highly variable as
# to how many fields are provided. There is often a popup_html
# field in this JSON blob that contains HTML data relating to the
# location and whilst some of this is parsed by default, often there
# are fields such as addresses and phone numbers that need to be
# manually extracted by overriding the parse_item function of this
# store finder and then updating item fields using
# popup_html.xpath(...) queries.
