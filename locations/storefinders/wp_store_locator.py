# Source code for the WP Store Locator API call used by this spider:
# https://github.com/wp-plugins/wp-store-locator/blob/master/frontend/wpsl-ajax-functions.php
#
# There are two ways to use this spider:
# 1. Attempt to return all locations with a single query.
#      Specify allowed_domains = [x, y, ..] (either one or more
#      domains such as example.net) and the default path for the WP
#      Store Locator API endpoint will be used. In the event the
#      default path is different, you can alternatively specify one
#      or more start_urls = [x, y, ..].
# 2. Perform a geographic radius search with multiple queries.
#      In addition to method (1), also supply a list of searchable
#      points files as searchable_points_files = [x, y..] and also
#      specify a non-zero number for search_radius = x and
#      max_results = x. The max_results parameter is hard-coded in
#      server configuration and cannot be changed. No radius search
#      should return max_results locations because this is a sign
#      that some locations are being truncated.
#
#      An exception will be raised if max_results (or more)
#      locations are returned in any given radius search, as this
#      indicates some locations have been truncated. If this occurs,
#      more granular searchable points files need to be supplied,
#      and search_raidus needs to be selected carefully to ensure
#      that max_results (or more) locations are never returned for
#      any radius search.
#
# If clean ups or additional field extraction is required from the
# source data, override the parse_item function. Two parameters are
# passed, item (an ATP "Feature" class) and location (a dict which
# is returned from the store locator JSON response for a particular
# location).
