# Source code and some limited documentation for the Limesharp Store
# Locator (also known as "Stockists") is available from:
# https://github.com/motou/magento2-store-locator-stockists-extension
#
# To use this store finder, specify allowed_domains = [x, y, ..]
# (either one or more domains such as example.net) and the default
# path for the Limesharp Store Locator API endpoint will be used.
# In the event the default path is different, you can alternatively
# specify one or more start_urls = [x, y, ..].
#
# If clean ups or additional field extraction is required from the
# source data, override the parse_item function. Two parameters are
# passed, item (an ATP "Feature" class) and location (a dict which
# is returned from the store locator JSON response for a particular
# location).
