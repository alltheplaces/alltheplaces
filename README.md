# All the Places

A project to generate
[point of interest (POI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_interest)
data sourced primarily from major websites with 'store location' pages,
The project is built using [`scrapy`](https://scrapy.org/),
a Python-based web scraping framework. Each target website gets
its own [spider](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html), which
does the work of extracting the detail.
Many of the sites provide their data in a [standard format](docs/STRUCTURED_DATA.md).
Others export their data [via simple APIs](docs/API_SPIDER.md).
The output from running the project is [published on a regular cadence](docs/WEEKLY_RUN.md)
to our website: [alltheplaces.xyz](https://www.alltheplaces.xyz/).

## Getting started

If you feel that you would like to contribute, and that would be great, then

Communication is primarily through tickets on the project
GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/alltheplaces/alltheplaces/issues).
Many contributors are also present on
[OSM US Slack](https://slack.openstreetmap.us/),
in particular we watch the [#poi](https://osmus.slack.com/archives/CDJ4LKA2Y)
channel.
