# All the Places

A project to generate [point of interest (POI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_interest) data sourced [primarily from major websites](docs/WHY_SPIDER.md) with 'store location' pages. The project uses [`scrapy`](https://scrapy.org/), a popular Python-based web scraping framework, to write individual site [spiders](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html) to retrieve POI data, publishing the results in a [standard format](DATA_FORMAT.md). There are various `scrapy` tutorials, [this series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4jtkzHhLzY) is reasonable.

## Getting started

### Development setup

Windows users may need to follow some extra steps, please follow the [scrapy docs](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html#windows) for upto date details.

1. Clone a copy of the project from the [GitHub All The Places](https://github.com/alltheplaces/alltheplaces/) repo (or your own fork if you are considering contributing to the project):

   ```
   $ git clone git@github.com:alltheplaces/alltheplaces.git
   ```

1. If you haven't done so already, [install `pipenv`](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv#installation) and check that it runs:

   ```
   $ pipenv --version
   pipenv, version 2022.8.30
   ```

1. Use `pipenv` to install the project dependencies:

   ```
   $ cd alltheplaces
   $ pipenv install
   ```

1. Test for successful project installation:

   ```
   $ pipenv run scrapy
   ```

   If the above runs without complaint, then you have a functional installation and are ready to run and write spiders.

### Contributing code

Many of the sites provide their data in a [standard format](docs/STRUCTURED_DATA.md). Others export their data [via simple APIs](docs/API_SPIDER.md). We have a number of guides to help you develop spiders:

* [What should I call my spider?](docs/SPIDER_NAMING.md)
* [Using Wikidata and the Name Suggestion Index](docs/WIKIDATA.md)
* [Sitemaps make finding POI pages easier](docs/SITEMAP.md)
* [Data from many POI pages can be extracted without writing code](docs/STRUCTURED_DATA.md)
* [What is expected in a pull request?](docs/PULL_REQUEST.md)

### The weekly run

The output from running the project is [published on a regular cadence](docs/WEEKLY_RUN.md) to our website: [alltheplaces.xyz](https://www.alltheplaces.xyz/). You should not run all the spiders to pick up the output: the less the project "bothers" a website the more we will be tolerated.

## Contact us

Communication is primarily through tickets on the project GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/alltheplaces/alltheplaces/issues). Many contributors are also present on [OSM US Slack](https://slack.openstreetmap.us/), in particular we watch the [#poi](https://osmus.slack.com/archives/CDJ4LKA2Y) channel.
