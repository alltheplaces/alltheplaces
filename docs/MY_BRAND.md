## My brand

Every business wants to be found. Nobody is trying to hide.
A common complaint from brand owners towards map and application
suppliers is that their brand data is poorly presented
(in particular location co-ordinates) or missing entirely.

The smaller a brand the less likely mapping companies will
take an interest in *getting it right*. This is a
shame as most brands invest a great deal of energy in getting
it right on *their own website*. Geography also plays a part
where some markets are deemed more important than others.

What if there was a way to take the effort invested in
your website and in a lightweight (no infrastructure needed)
manner provide it, in a *one stop shop*, to others as you wish it
to be shown? Change your data and watch it
filter through into others maps and applications!




There is now a frictionless way to do this. Simply add a small piece
of software to this project that talks to your website or brand
marketing partner ([we interface to many of these](../locations/storefinders)). It's a trivial
piece of work for major improvements in the ability of people to
find and travel to your locations.

already written a spider for your brand. If so why don't you
take on the task of maintaining it? This way when you change your
website / API / details you can ensure that ....
