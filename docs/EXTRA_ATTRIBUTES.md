## I found a site that gives a lot of useful, nuanced information; how do I model it in AllThePlaces?

We provide the `Extras` enum from `location.categories`, as well as the `apply_yes_no` helper.

This is great for modelling common (or even uncommon) atrributes like:

* Wheelchair accessibility
* Wifi
* Payment methods
* Fuel types
* Dietary compatibility

and more.
