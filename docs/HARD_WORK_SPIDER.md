## Hard work spider

Many sites export clean [structured data](./STRUCTURED_DATA.md)
or have a simple [JSON API](./API_SPIDER.md) available.
Many sites index their store pages with a [sitemap](./SITEMAP.md).
A good deal of other sites are what we might call **hard work**,
lacking much of the aforementioned support.
These sites are to be avoided, if you can,
[but if you must](./WHY_SPIDER.md),
then we have some tips to help with writing your spider.

### Using the scrapy shell

Digging around in HTML responses for data is fiddly.

Instead of `pipenv run scrapy crawl` every time you want to try your spider, you can
use the [`scrapy shell`](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/shell.html) to load
a page and experiment with XPath queries. When you're happy with the query,
you can use it in your code. This is a lot easier than running
a `crawl` every time you make a change to your spider.

To enter the shell, use `pipenv run scrapy shell http://example.com` (where you replace
the URL with your own). It will dump you into a Python shell after having requested the
page and parsing it. Once in the shell, you can do things with the `response` object
as if you were in your spider. The shell also offers a shortcut function
called `fetch()` that lets you pull up a different page, once again setting the
`response` object.

For example from within the `scrapy shell`:

```
>>> fetch("https://www.wickes.co.uk/store/8093")
2022-11-06 14:02:14 [scrapy.core.engine] DEBUG: (200) <GET https://www.wickes.co.uk/store/8093>
>>> response.xpath("//@data-latitude").get()
'51.446565'
>>> fetch("https://www.wickes.co.uk/store/8093")
2022-11-06 14:02:18 [scrapy.core.engine] DEBUG: (200) <GET https://www.wickes.co.uk/store/8093>
```

Use your **&#8593;** (up-arrow) key to recall and edit previous command lines
in the shell session, you will use this quite regularly to refine your
XPath query until happy.

### Keep your XPath queries simple

Or as simple as you **sensibly** can. For example, using a query which is
extremely brittle to the structure of the HTML is a very bad idea. For example:

```python
item["lat"] = response.xpath("/html/body/section/div[2]/div[{}]/div[1]//@data-latitude").get()
```

is not a good idea, when if as is most likely, there is only one such attribute on the page, this works:

```python
item["lat"] = response.xpath("//@data-latitude").get()
```

Some people will write lots of code to extract every last piece
of POI data from a page. Do not fall for this temptation, do what
is important and easy.

### Our libraries may still be of help

Remember that many of our libraries may prove helpful to you, even though
they are primarily intended for more structured data.

You may be able to form a useful dictionary without too much effort then give it to
[DictParser](../locations/dict_parser.py).

[OpeningHours](../locations/hours.py) will also be useful
if your site is important enough to merit the effort.

### Hybrid spider

Frequently you will find that a site exports most of its information
simply (for example via structured data), but that some important fields may
only be retrieved by digging around in the HTML.

For example, the [wikckes_gb.py](../locations/spiders/wickes_gb.py) spider
is a very simple example of good structured data present but not latitude
and longitude. These are available but must be dug out of the page with
a `response.xpath` query.


### Coordinate Reference Systems

All our spiders emit geographic coordinates as latitude/longitude
pairs according to the World Geodetic System WGS84, which is used by
GPS and nearly all online mapping services. To convert coordinates
from other reference systems to WGS84, we use
[proj](https://proj.org/) via its Python wrapper
[pyproj](https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/examples.html).  For
example, the [winterthur_ch.py](../locations/spiders/winterthur_ch.py)
spider converts [Swiss CH1903+/LV95 coordinates](https://epsg.io/2056)
to WGS84.


### Doing is learning

The bottom line here is that a lot of the techniques for spidering POI data
you will learn by experience. The inquisitive may also look around existing
spiders for possible inspiration. There is always some new "trick" to learn!
